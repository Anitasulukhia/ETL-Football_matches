# ETL-Football_matches
Developed ETL processes and data pipelines to automate data extraction, transformation, and loading using Airflow. Analyzed historical match data, applying machine learning algorithms to predict match scores and gain insights into team performance.

Project Overview

This project automates the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of match data using Apache Airflow, with PostgreSQL as the data storage. The pipeline extracts data, processes it, and stores it in a PostgreSQL database. Machine learning models are applied to predict match scores based on historical data. The entire setup is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.

Features

ETL Pipeline:
Built using Apache Airflow, this pipeline automates the extraction of match data from external sources, transforms it for analysis, and loads it into a PostgreSQL database.
Data Storage:
All match data is stored in a PostgreSQL database for easy querying and management.
Machine Learning:
Machine learning models, including regression and classification algorithms, are trained to predict match scores and analyze team performance based on historical data.
Docker Containers:
The entire project is containerized using Docker, ensuring consistent development and production environments. Airflow, PostgreSQL, and other components are packaged into separate containers, making deployment and scaling seamless.
Automation:
The entire process, from data extraction to score prediction, is fully automated, allowing for continuous model updates and predictions without manual intervention.
Technologies Used

Python: For data processing, machine learning, and automation.
Apache Airflow: For orchestrating the ETL pipeline and automating data workflows.
PostgreSQL: For storing and querying match data.
Docker: For containerizing the application and ensuring consistent environments.
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
SQLAlchemy: For handling database interactions within the Python environment.
Project Structure

Docker:
Dockerfiles are used to build images for PostgreSQL, Airflow, and the application, ensuring a uniform environment across all stages of the project.
Airflow DAGs:
Airflow Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) define the ETL process, orchestrating tasks like data extraction, transformation, and loading into the PostgreSQL database.
Machine Learning Models:
The models are trained using historical match data stored in PostgreSQL, evaluated for prediction accuracy, and used for predicting future match outcomes.
Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_directory>
2. Build and start Docker containers
Ensure Docker is installed, then run the following command to build and start the containers:

docker-compose up --build
This will:

Set up the PostgreSQL container and initialize the database.
Set up the Apache Airflow container and start the scheduler and web server.
3. Install Python dependencies
If running outside of Docker, install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Set up PostgreSQL
Ensure that PostgreSQL is running in the container.
The ETL pipeline will automatically insert data into the PostgreSQL database.
5. Configure Airflow
Access the Airflow web UI at http://localhost:8080.
Configure and trigger the ETL pipeline by running the associated Airflow DAGs.
6. Run the ETL pipeline
The pipeline can be triggered manually or run on a scheduled basis through Airflow. The ETL process extracts data, loads it into PostgreSQL, and triggers model training to predict match scores.

7. Model Training and Prediction
Once data is loaded into PostgreSQL, the machine learning models are trained on the data and used to predict future match scores. The models can be retrained periodically with new data to improve accuracy.

Docker Configuration

The project uses docker-compose to manage the containers:

PostgreSQL: Database container for storing match data.
Airflow: Orchestrates the ETL pipeline.
App: Contains the Python application for data processing and machine learning.
The docker-compose.yml file defines the services, volumes, and networks needed for the project.

Example Workflow

Data Extraction:
Airflow pulls raw match data from external APIs or CSV files.
Data Transformation:
The data is cleaned, preprocessed, and formatted for database insertion.
Data Insertion:
The cleaned data is inserted into a PostgreSQL database using Airflow tasks.
Machine Learning:
Historical data in the database is used to train models and predict future match scores.
Automation:
The ETL process runs on a schedule, automatically updating the database and retraining the models as new data becomes available.
